<div class="r"><p>Hello, my name is Oumar Ouonogo. I am 20 years old, originally
     from Mali but currently living in Hungary, where I am pursuing a Bachelor's
      degree in Computer Science Engineering.</p>
  
  <p>I do speak three languages fluently including my mother tongue which is Bambara, 
    and the other two languages are French and English. Additionally,I am currently learning 
    Hungarian to better integrate and connect with the local community.</p>
  
  <p>One of my recent projects is this website, which showcases my dedication
     to applying my skills and knowledge in practical, impactful ways.</p>

  <p>Beyond academics, I am committed to maintaining my physical condition 
    and overall well-being. I work out regularly to stay fit and energized,
    which also helps me stay focused and motivated in my studies and projects.</p>

  <p>I am continuously seeking opportunities to learn and grow, whether through internships,
    online courses, or collaborating on innovative projects with peers. 
    I believe that every experience is an opportunity to enhance my skills and broaden my horizons.</p>

    <p >Thank you for taking the time to get to know me. I look forward to connecting with like-minded 
    individuals and exploring potential collaborations or opportunities to share knowledge.</p>
